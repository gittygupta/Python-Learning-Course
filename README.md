# Python-Learning-Course
Hey guys! This is my repository of the very basics of python. This repo does not contain any practice problems - but just enough to familiarize you with the syntax and features of the language. The 'Tutorials' folder contains te basic tutorials then you may move on to the 'Pillow editing' part or the web scrapper.

Thanks - Aousnik
